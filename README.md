## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
Personalized Crop and Fertilizer Recommendations – Suggests the most suitable crops and optimal fertilizer use for each farm plot.

Pest and Disease Advisory – Detects potential pest or disease risks using image recognition or predictive modeling and suggests eco-friendly control measures.

Multi-Language Support – Provides guidance in regional languages to overcome language barriers.

Low-Tech Accessibility – Works on basic smartphones or through SMS/voice-based services for farmers with low digital literacy.

Localized Insights – Incorporates local weather forecasts, soil data, and historical crop performance for accurate recommendations.

Cost and Yield Optimization – Helps reduce input costs, increase productivity, and minimize environmental impact.
## Technical Approach
Data Collection:

Gather farm-level data including soil type, moisture, pH, and historical crop records.

Collect local weather data (temperature, rainfall, humidity) from IoT sensors or public APIs.

Acquire images of crops for pest/disease detection using mobile cameras.

Data Preprocessing:

Clean and normalize soil, weather, and crop datasets.

Annotate images for pest and disease recognition.

Handle missing or inconsistent data for reliable predictions.

AI/ML Model Development:

Crop Recommendation: Use supervised learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to suggest optimal crops based on soil, climate, and historical yield.

Fertilizer Optimization: Build predictive models to recommend ideal fertilizer types and quantities.

Pest/Disease Detection: Implement computer vision models (CNNs) to detect crop pests or diseases from uploaded images.

Yield Prediction: Predict potential yield based on historical data and real-time inputs.

Platform Development:

Mobile Application / Web Interface: User-friendly interface supporting regional languages.

Voice/SMS Integration: For farmers with low digital literacy or feature phones.

Dashboard: Real-time insights for crop health, input recommendations, and weather alerts.

Integration & Deployment:

Connect ML models with the mobile/web platform through APIs.

Deploy on cloud services for scalability and real-time processing.

Periodically update models with new data to improve prediction accuracy.

Feedback Loop:

Collect farmer feedback to improve recommendations.

Continuously refine models based on local results and seasonal variations.
## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility: The solution leverages widely available technologies like AI/ML, IoT sensors, and mobile platforms. Cloud deployment and SMS/voice integration make it accessible even to farmers with basic phones, ensuring practical implementation.

Viability: By improving crop yield, reducing input costs, and minimizing environmental impact, the platform offers clear economic benefits to farmers. It also has potential for scale across regions, making it commercially and socially sustainable.
## Impact and Benefits
Increases crop yield and farm profitability.

Reduces input costs and chemical overuse.

Provides personalized, real-time guidance in local languages.

Promotes sustainable and eco-friendly farming practices.

Empowers small and marginal farmers with modern agri-tech access.
